# Zombie-Octo-cake
Goals: build an octo-pi style control/access board for my ender3_4.2.7_touch_BLT. 
  I am intending to utilize this as a leaning excersize. therefore I will vbe "attempting" to utlize hardware from three or four old spare laptops I have laying around the house. 
  all of these boards have nothing wrong with them, however I might have to make purchases for things like connector pins. Essentially I am looking for guidance, and any other assistance with coding, troubleshooting etc. 
  I also wanted to use this project as a chance to learn to actually contribute to this AMAZING community of programmers, problem solvers, and radically intelligent people that is GITHUB. 
  IF: project time is >1month, Then: I expect my fiancee will having me simply purchase an actual pre-made octi-pi. But I will still proceed with this project as though I havent since I need to find a use for these old laptops or actually get rid of them.
